## Functions are First Class Citizens

    - Meaning you can treat functions like any other variable in the language.
    - For example, you can pass a function as an argument to another function or a function can be returned by another function and assigned to a variable.

### Storing a function in a variable.

```jsx
const example = () => {
  console.log("This is an example");
};
```

Invoking the function by using the variable it was stored in.

```jsx
example();
```

---

### Passing a function as a variable

```jsx
function sayName() {
  return "Coner";
}

function shout(text) {
  return text.toUpperCase();
}
```

We call `sayName()` which returns 'Coner' this is then immediately passed to shout() which returns it in the upper case.

```jsx
console.log(shout(sayName()));
```

---

### Returing a function

If we want to invoke the function returned from another function we have a couple of options:

#### Option 1

```jsx
const sayName = function () {
  return function () {
    console.log("Coner");
  };
};
```

But, directly invoking our function doesn't yeild the result we wanted.

```jsx
sayName(); // Doesn't return 'Coner' instead directly returns the function.
```

To achieve the result we want of logging out 'Coner', we have store our function into another variable and invoke that.

```jsx
const func = sayName();

func(); // 'Coner'
```

#### Option 2

```jsx
const sayName = function () {
  return function () {
    console.log("Coner");
  };
};
```

If we want to avoid using the variable method shown above we can use the double parentheses method to invoke the parent function and then the child function it returns which gives us the result we were after.

```jsx
sayName()(); // 'Coner'
```
