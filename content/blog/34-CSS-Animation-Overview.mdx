## What are they?

CSS Animations are a way of animating elements in CSS without any external libraries or the use of JS.

CSS Animations contain 2 parts:

1. A style describing the animation
2. A set of keyframes that state the start and end properties of the animation.

## Defining Animations

Before we can actually use animations we need to define the animation, this is done with the keyframes at-rule in CSS.

Syntax using from/to:

```css
@keyframes <ANIMATION NAME> {
  from {
    color: #000000;
  }
  to {
    color: #ffffff;
  }
}
```

Syntax using percentages:

```css
@keyframes <ANIMATION NAME> {
  0% {
    color: #000000;
  }
  50% {
    color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
  }
  100% {
    color: #ffffff;
  }
}
```

By using percentages we can add more points into the animation, compared to the from/to method where we can only define the start and stop points.

You can also mix and match from/to and percentages as well:

```css
@keyframes <ANIMATION NAME> {
  from {
    color: #000000;
  }
  60% {
    color: rgb(200, 0, 0);
  }
  to {
    color: #ffffff;
  }
}
```

## Animation Properties

There are 8 animation properties that we can use to contorl and configure the animation.

**Animation properties do not control the style of the animation! That happens with Keyframes**

1. [animation-name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-name)
2. [animation-duration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-duration)
3. [animation-timing-function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function)
4. [animation-delay](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-delay)
5. [animation-iteration-count](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-iteration-count)
6. [animation-direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-direction)
7. [animation-fill-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-fill-mode)
8. [animation-play-state](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-play-state)

### animation-name

**Description:**
Specifies the name of the @keyframes animation that will be given to the element.

**Example:**

```css
animation-name: ANIMATION_NAME;
```

### animation-duration

**Description:**
Allows for control of the length of the animation to complete one cycle. Time given in either Seconds(s) or Milliseconds(ms).

**Example:**

```css
animation-duration: 1s;
animation-duration: 500ms;
```

### animation-timing-function

**Description:**
Controls how the animation progresses through the keyframes by establishing an accerelation curve.

**Example:**

```css
animation-timing-function: linear;
animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.1, 0.7, 1, 0.1);
```

### animation-delay

**Description:**
Controls the delay between the element loading and the animation starting. Controlled in either Seconds(s) or Milliseconds(ms).

**Example:**

```css
animation-delay: 1s;
animation-delay: 500ms;
```

### animation-iteration-count

**Description:**
Controls how many times the animation will repeat for. If given as `infinite` then the animation will repeat forever.

**Example:\***

```css
animation-iteration-count: 5;
```

### animation-direction

**Description:**
Controls the direction of the animation, starting at 0% to 100% (normal) or 100% to 0% (reverse). Or, if set to alternate will change on each completion of the animation.

**Example:**

```css
animation-direction: normal;
animation-direction: alternate;
```

### animation-fill-mode

**Description:**
Controls the styles applying to the element after the animation has finished.

If set to `forwards` then the animation will persist the final animation styling after it finishes.

If set to `backwards` then the animation will revert back to the styling prior to the animation.

**Example:**

```css
animation-fill-mode: none;
animation-fill-mode: forwards;
```

### animation-play-state

**Description:**
Allows for playing and pausing of an animation.

**Example:**

```css
animation-play-state: running;
animation-play-state: paused;
```

## Animation Shorthand CSS

You can set the animation properies in one line using the CSS Shorthand `animation`.

```css
/* @keyframes duration | easing-function | delay |
iteration-count | direction | fill-mode | play-state | name */

animation: 3s ease-in 1s 2 reverse both paused slidein;

/* @keyframes name | duration | easing-function | delay */
animation: slidein 3s linear 1s;

/* @keyframes name | duration */
animation: slidein 3s;
```

## Setting Multiple Animations

If we use the longhand CSS animation properties covered above, we can define multiple CSS animations in one go.

```css
animation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft300px, bounce;
animation-duration: 3s;
animation-iteration-count: 1;
```

In this example, because there is 3 animations but only one duration and iteration-count properties they will all inherit these properties.

```css
animation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft300px, bounce;
animation-duration: 2.5s, 5s, 1s;
animation-iteration-count: 2, 1, 5;
```

In this example, because there is enough properties for all of the animations they will inherit their respective placed property.

For example, the first defined animation `fadeInOut` will inherit the first defined properties: 2.5s and 2.

```css
animation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft300px, bounce;
animation-duration: 2.5s, 5s;
animation-iteration-count: 2, 1;
```

In this final case, as there isn't enough properties for all of the defined animations, CSS will loop through them.

For example, `fadeInOut` gets 2.5s and 2, `moveLeft300px` gets 5s and 1 and then it goes back to the start so `bounce` will get 2.5s and 2 again.
