Recently, while I was updating my website I also wanted to upgrade the NodeJS version. Having explored this path in the past I knew it could be painful.

So on I went down the journey of upgrading NodeJS. I found there is multiple ways of tackling this problem. But, the best method I found is [NVM or Node Version Manager.](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

In this post, we'll look at using NVM to install multiple NodeJS versions and how to switch between them at the drop of a hat.

## Installing NVM

To install NVM it's as simple as running the authors install script which you can find [here.](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/v0.38.0/install.sh) You can either paste this into your terminal or you can run one of the below `curl` or `wget` commands to do it for you:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash

wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
```

After running this script, you should notice the NVM repository has been copied into a `~/.nvm` folder. Following this, the below code should now be added to your current terminal profile.

For example, I use ZSH for my terminal which is located in `~/.zshrc`. After installing NVM I should find the below code copied into that file.

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

If everything went smoothly, NVM should now be installed!

## Using NVM

Using NVM is simple, let's take a look at some of the most common commands you'll use:

### Installing a New NodeJS Version

To install a new NodeJS version, you can use one of the below commands.

To get the latest version you can run:

```bash
nvm install node # "node" is an alias for the latest version
```

Or, if you have a particular version in mind:

```bash
nvm install 14.8.0 # or 10.10.0, 8.9.1, etc
```

_NOTE: The first version you install becomes the default that new shell windows use._

### Checking Installed NodeJS Versions

If you want to check what versions of Node you have installed you can run:

```bash
nvm ls
```

### Checking What NodeJS Versions Can Be installed.

If you're interested in seeing what versions you can install using NVM, you can run:

```bash
nvm ls-remote
```

### Switching NodeJS Versions

To switch between versions you can use:

```bash
nvm use 14.8.0 # or 10.10.0, 8.9.1, etc
```

### Uninstalling Old NodeJS Versions

If you want to uninstall a version of Node you no longer need:

```bash
nvm uninstall 14.8.0 # or 10.10.0, 8.9.1, etc
```

## Troubleshooting

If you were like me and run into the error `nvm: command not found` every time you try to run one of these commands. Or, you have another issue you can check out the troubleshooting section on the [NVM GitHub Repo.](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#additional-notes)

Unfortunately, my issue wasn't on the troubleshooting section so I had to do some digging. Here's how I solved it.

After retracing my steps, I found that the original install script hadn't added the below code to my `~/.zshrc`.

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

After I opened my `~/.zshrc` file and dropped in that code at the bottom, NVM started to work. If you're getting the `nvm: command not found` error try the troubleshooting guide first. If that doesn't help, check it was installed correctly.

If neither of these work I would recommend opening an issue on GitHub for some support.

## Conclusion

That's it! NVM should now be installed and you should be able to install and use as many NodeJS versions as you please.
