Hey friends ðŸ‘‹

Today is a momentous day.

It marks the first email newsletter I've sent out since starting my newsletter list. I would share an actual time and date with you when I founded the list but in all honesty, I started the list so long ago I can't actually remember when I did it. Bad on my part I know...

Anyway, I don't want to spend too much time dwelling on the past because we can't change that. But, what can change and influence if how we proceed going forward.

So, starting today Sunday 10th October 2021 expect a new email to drop into your inbox every Sunday.

You may be asking what is this newsletter going to be on, good question. Let's cover that now.

## Content

I'll be completely honest with you, this newsletter isn't dedicated to one individual topic. It's not just about

- Money Making
- Content Creation
- Coding / Development

Truth be told, I have an interest in all of those topics and more so for this newsletter I didn't want to focus on just one topic and help just a particular subset of people.

Instead, I want to try to help as many people as possible in their pursuit of happiness, success, productivity and more. You may be asking how am I planning on doing that?

Another good question.

The reality of the situation is I don't know how to give someone any of those things because I'm still figuring it out, I'm still in pursuit of all of those things myself.

And, that is the reason I believe this newsletter can do some good.

Throughout the editions, I'll be sharing my successes, failings, stories, journies, lessons and more so we can all learn together.

## The Outline

The structure of this newsletter will be pretty much the same from week to week and that is:

- A Story / Lesson I learnt from the week
- What I've been working on / doing the past week
- Review of the past week goals and tasks
- Planning for my next week
- Cool and helpful things to check out

I don't want this newsletter to come off as me telling you I know everything and here is exactly what you should be doing because that's not the case.

That's why I want to share everything I'm currently doing with you, how I'm learning from it, what my next steps are and most importantly that I'm human just like the rest of the world.

So, that's the newsletter. The first proper edition of it will be out on 17/10/21 or a week from now.

I look forward to seeing you there and sharing everything I've been up to.

Let me know what your plans are for the coming week over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrConerMurphy/), I'd love to chat with you.

See you next week

Coner
