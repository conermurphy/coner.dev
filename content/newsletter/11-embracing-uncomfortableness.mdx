Hey Friends 👋

I hope you're doing well and have had a great week?

Today, I want to talk about the feeling of being uncomfortable.

We're often taught that the feeling of being uncomfortable is a bad thing from a young age. We're taught it means something is wrong or that we did something wrong. But, I don't think this is the case.

Yes, if you're physically stuck inside of a smaller space than your body, something may have gone wrong and that would be uncomfortable. But, in most other situations being uncomfortable is a good thing I believe.

For example, this last week, I came across this exact feeling. I have booked in 2 commissioned articles (Yay)... but both have short deadlines... (Noo).

Naturally, after realising the little amount of time I had and the work ahead of me, the feelings of uncomfortableness and stress began to set in. At first, you want to run away, you want to remove yourself from the situation.

I suppose this is only natural. If you put your hand over a fire the reaction is to remove your hand as soon as you feel the heat. We've been wired this way for millennia to protect ourselves and ensure our survival as a species.

But, outside of situations that cause us pain, the inherited reaction to remove ourselves from uncomfortable situations can do more harm than good.

For example, if I quit the 2 articles and say I can't do it. What do I gain? Nothing.

But, if I push myself through the uncomfortableness and challenge myself to the work, what do I gain? Possible future opportunities and more work.

This is why I believe being uncomfortable is a good thing, it means we are growing, we are challenging ourselves and in the end, becoming a better, improved version of ourselves.

So, next time you're faced with an uncomfortable situation, fight the urge to run away and hide from the source and instead jump in with two feet forward and embrace the challenge.

That is unless it is a fire, then running is probably a good idea...

## 🏃‍♂️ What I've Up To

This week, I've been working on the blog page of the [PhyType Website](https://phytype.com/) which is now finished. I just need to make it live and get to writing posts. 😅

I have also done some research for the first post on the PhyType website so I hope to start writing that soon.

Outside of the world of PhyType, I've been creating content on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrConerMurphy/) again which has been great fun and I've been pitching blog post ideas to blogs and companies of which I now have 2 to write. 😄
