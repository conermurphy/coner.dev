Hey Friends üëã

I hope you're all doing well and had a great week?

We are now two days into 2022. How are your new year's resolutions going, if you have any this year? Or, if not new year's resolutions, what about any goals you're working towards? Have you spent the last few days working towards them or just getting some extra holiday time in?

One of my goals for this year is to grow my online presence across various platforms such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrConerMurphy), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKbxBnz1xuyGAPMCOZQRdVw) and [my website.](https://conermurphy.com/)

So, far it's been going quite well (although, it's hard to say after two days). üòÖ

But, one thought that I had come to terms with over the holiday period when thinking about this goal is that we shouldn't be embarrassed about self-promotion because ultimately we can't rely on someone else doing it for us.

I'm not saying you need to talk about yourself every minute of every day. In fact, the opposite, self-promotion should be once or twice per week. If you're a Twitter user like myself, that might take the form of a tweet you send out once per week to remind your old followers and any new ones you may have gotten that week of what you do.

For example, once a week on a Sunday, I send out a tweet reminding people of this newsletter with a link to the latest edition for people to read. I also drop a hint to subscribe to the newsletter if they find it interesting.

For the rest of the week, I only share content that serves to inform or entertain and isn't about me or the things I do. These tweets might be development tips and tricks or threads explaining a concept. In other words, it's content that helps others in some way.

And it's this balance that I think is vital to doing self-promotion properly. If you ask nothing of your followers or subscribers for a reasonable period and then ask something of them once they tend to not care. After all, you put out helpful content every day, a small bit of self-promotion can be tolerated. But, if the same followers or subscribers was inundated every day with requests to buy something or subscribe to something new, would they stick around? I'm not too sure. There is only so much an individual can take of one person talking about themself.

In summary, self-promotion is good. If you're trying to build a following, sell products or attract new users to your service you will need to do it. But, make sure you do it in the right proportions and the self-promotion is the minority of the content you produce, not the majority. Make the majority, content that helps others.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Reply to this email and let me know what the right amount of self-promotion is for you? And, how much you can take of someone doing it?

Thank you for reading and as always I hope you have a great week next week.
