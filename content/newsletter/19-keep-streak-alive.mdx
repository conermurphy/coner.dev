Hey Friends 👋

It's well-established that if you want to excel in something, you need to consistently put effort into it. It doesn't matter if it's running, weightlifting, career changes or building an online presence. To achieve goals in any of those areas we have to consistently show up day after day and put some time in.

But, not all days need to be equal...

Let's be real for a moment, in an ideal world when we work towards our goals it would be hours every day but we don't live in this ideal world. Life gets in the way.

This is okay and is what I wanted to talk about today.

I've been reading a lot of [James Clear's Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/1847941834) recently and in one of the chapter's he talks about the idea of just keeping the momentum going.

It doesn't matter if we turn up to the gym and only do a 5-minute workout. We still went to the gym and did a workout. What was important, wasn't the workout but instead that we kept our streak going.

This logic extends to achieving goals in my opinion. There will be days when we can't work towards our goals as much as we would like to and that's okay. The important thing is keeping our streak going and doing something to progress us forward even if that's only 1% or 0.5% closer to our goal.

I experienced this first-hand this weekend. My goal is to create 3-5 pieces of content on Twitter every day. Normally, I try to schedule this all in advance on the weekend prior. But, this weekend, life got in the way, it's already Sunday evening and all I've managed to schedule is tweets for Monday.

This isn't ideal, I couldn't work as much as I wanted to because life got in the way. So, instead, I did enough to keep my streak going. Then throughout the week when I have more time (and energy), I'll revisit it and schedule more content.

You don't need to put in the same amount of effort each day, some days will be slumps, that's okay; just keep the streak going. 😊

I hope you have an amazing week next week and I look forward to chatting to you again next Sunday for the 20th edition of this newsletter.

Doesn't the time fly these days? 😅

Thank you for reading.

**P.S.** I'm thinking of changing the name of the newsletter series to _"Weekly Ramblings"_, a bit more fitting, don't you think? I'd love to hear your thoughts on it so feel free to reply to this email and let me know what you think.

## 🏃‍♂️ What I've Been Up To

Going to be completely honest, not much this week. I started the gym again which has been on my to-do list since the start of the year. Better late than never right. 😅

In terms of coding, I added the forgot password journey into the authentication part of StatBase. Authentication is nearly complete now, I just need to sort out some styling/responsiveness issues. Look out for this update on Twitter soon. 👀

## 🎤 DevSpace

This week, we had an amazing discussion on communities and how to be an active member of one. It went on for nearly 2 hours so a bit beyond what we normally do, but it was full of nuggets of info.
