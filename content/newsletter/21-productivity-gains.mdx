Hey Friends üëã

I hope you had a productive week and a relaxing weekend?

This week, I've been exploring the world of productivity and changes I can make to improve my productivity. I've been doing this alongside reading [The Productivity Project by Chris Bailey](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Productivity-Project-Proven-Become-Awesome/dp/0349413053) In this book Chris documents his journey with productivity and more importantly his year-long project to improve his productivity and maximise his gains.

Something that has stuck with me from his book is the idea that to be more productive, you don't need to do more work. You just need to work on the right tasks that yield the most progress towards your goals and aspirations.

This is where I think I've been failing in my work and something I aim to change in the coming days and weeks.

Upon reflection, I've realised that I spend a lot of time creating content for Social Media. But, while this does contribute to my goals because of the quantity I aim to produce at the moment, it prevents me from working on actual projects like my SaaS, StatBase and blogging/product creation where the return on investment is potentially higher.

To put my words where my mouth is and practice what I preach, this coming week I'm experimenting with reducing the content I create for Social Media to free up more time for project work. I'm hoping that by doing this and planning out the content ahead of time, I'm able to make more progress on other projects and in turn make more progress towards my goals.

In support of this more organised structure to content creation and project work, I'm also implementing another concept from the book, "The Rule of 3". Every day I'm going to write down 3 things I want to achieve that day, ideally, these will be things that push me to make progress but are also realistic.

I hope by implementing these two strategies and hopefully finding a good solution for a to-do list (something I've been trying to do for months), I'm able to resolve my productivity issues...

Have you tried out any of these productivity methods or tips? If so, how did you find it? I'd love to hear about your experiences. If you haven't then why not give it a shot and we can try it out together.

As always I hope you have a great week, this coming week.

Thank you for reading,

Coner x
