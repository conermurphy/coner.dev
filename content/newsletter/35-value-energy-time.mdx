Hey Friends 👋

Since starting my new role at the end of April, I've massively scaled back on my side projects, creative pursuits, and other ventures. In my opinion, this is to be expected as it makes sense to focus your efforts on a single new pursuit to ensure success, passing probation, etc.

However, with this said, being now six weeks into my post, I'm starting to feel that I'm getting my head above water, understanding my role, along with the impact I can have on the team, project, and product.

With this level of clarity, I can start to direct some energy and time back towards any creative pursuits and side-projects.

The issue is, what side projects do I pursue?

This was a much harder question to answer than I anticipated. Do I carry on with existing side projects that I have but aren't passionate about? Do I think about projects with the highest possible return on investment and chase them? Or, do something else completely different?

In the end, this is how I approached it.

> What has the most value right now? What project or goal has the highest value to me? Whatever I feel that to be, invest time, and energy in realizing that.

So, do I pursue a YouTube Channel? Double down on my blog? Create a new coding project? Or, Something else entirely?

Now, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted by all of the above. A YouTube channel is most certainly on the cards. But I'm still fleshing out the details and planning for that so right now it isn't an immediate option.

So, what am I going to be doing? I'm going to be splitting my time between writing regular content on my blog supplemented with bits on social media (much less than before though 😅). And, then also working on a new side project.

What about StatBase some of you may ask? Well, StatBase has been on a bit of a hiatus for the last few months and unfortunately, I think it's going to be staying that way for a bit longer.

Why?

Because I've been bitten by the shinny item syndrome. 😂

I've come up with a new project idea that I'm more passionate about and in my opinion, has a much wider potential audience and impact if done right. Plus, it's going to be cool to learn and build along the way.

What is it, you may be asking?

Drum roll please... 🥁

I'm not revealing that information just yet. Sorry. 🙏

It's very much just a concept right now and I want to spend some time working on it along with fleshing out my initial plan for the project before announcing it. But, it's coming soon, I promise that!

## Creativity List Update 📅

As promised last week here is my week one update after starting my daily creativity list that is hopefully going to be the solution to any drought of content or ideas I may have.

Now, this week didn't quite go as planned due to me being ill for the majority of the week and being far from capable of doing any work or thinking of anything besides sleeping and sneezing. 😂

But, saying this, I did manage to complete three of the seven days. In turn, listing out 30 content ideas with three being made into concept pieces that could be turned into actual content, be that a video or blog post.

So, I have to say although this week didn't quite go as planned and I had some unforeseen hiccups, this exercise was great, so I'm going to be continuing it going forward indefinitely.

My next step is to try and organize my schedule better and find some free time to start on the content production journey. I'm hoping to pair this with systemizing the content production from the get-go so I can maximize the time I do free up.

In summary, the week-long trial, although not completed as expected was a great success and will be continuing. 🙌

## Thought, Question, Challenge 🤔

- **Thought**: Sometimes we have to be selfish and chase what has the most value to us, not others.
- **Question**: Are you spending a proportionate amount of energy to achieve a goal as the value it returns?
- **Challenge**: This week, list out all the goals you have and order them by their value. Then realign the energy you expend to achieve them.
