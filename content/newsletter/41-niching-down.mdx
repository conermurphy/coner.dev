Hey Friends 👋

For the last few days, I've been doing some thinking and planning for my social media and more specifically my Twitter account. I've been thinking more and more about where I want to go in the future and ultimately how building an audience and community can help enable that.

Up until now, my account has been relatively unfocused. Sure it's been focused on tech and being a developer. But, it's jumped between frontend development, backend development, building in public, open source, content creation, and a few other things. Tech is a big place... 😅

And, while it's fine to cover all these topics as they're all in tech, it still feels that the focus of the account is too broad in scope for people visiting my account to get a quick understanding of who I am, what I do, and the content they can expect from me. Right now if you visit my account, the impression is "he does something in web development", which is fine but I think it's time to try to hone my voice and create a more focused account. So, it's more "he does XXX in tech".

Or, to put it more simply, it's time to niche down. 😱

In the past, my concern with niching down has always been pigeonholing myself into something I don't want to do long term. But, after some reflection, I've realized that I don't need to niche down into specific languages/tech or part of web development like frontend or backend. Instead, I can niche down into something that lets me still build projects, share the tech I'm working with, and how the projects help me on my journey to financial independence via tech.

That niche is "Indie Hacking"/"Building in public". 🙌

In the end, this niche just made sense because I already spend a lot of time building projects and sharing them in public. So, why change from something I already do and enjoy? Instead, just do more of that and less of the stuff I don't enjoy.

So in closing, expect less generic web development content from me on social media and more updates, ideas, and project talk. 🤩

Thank you for reading as always.

## Actionable Takeaway 🏃‍♀️

I wanted to introduce a new section into the newsletter that sums up the newsletter into one key point people can take away and action. This is my first attempt at doing that so let's see how it goes. 😅

    Niche down your social media accounts to give people a clearer view of who you are, what you do, and what they can expect from you.

## Hackathon Update 💻

The designs are complete for the project and the building is about to begin. This means I can put the developer hat on and leave it on; full steam ahead building now. 💪

Unfortunately, there isn't much to show right now but with 2 weeks left of the hackathon, I'm hoping I'll have something to show next week. Otherwise, I'm going to have some late nights ahead of me... 😂

## Thought, Question, Challenge 🤔

- **Thought**: By niching your social media accounts, you can create a more active and engaged audience/community.
- **Question**: How could niching your social media accounts help you achieve your goals?
- **Challenge**: If you haven't already niched down; think about your interests and goals. How could social media help you achieve them by niching?
