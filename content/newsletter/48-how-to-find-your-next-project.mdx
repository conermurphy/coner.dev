Hey Friends üëã

After finishing the current project I have been working on for the last few weeks (my portfolio redesign, which you should totally check out here üëÄ), I have been in a bit of a limbo, wondering what project to work on next...

Now, this isn't the first time it's happened to me so I thought it might be a bit of a common occurrence for other builders and creators as well. So, with this in mind, in this week's edition, I wanted to share three methods for finding your next project to work on.

Let's get started. üöÄ

## 1. What problems or annoyances do you have?

This method says it all on the tin really. But, what problems or annoyances do you have or face regularly? Think about them and then make a list of them all, they can be small-ish things like a particular product or app not having a feature you want. Or, they can be large things like having to manually repeat time-consuming tasks.

The odds are if you're facing these issues regularly then others are as well. So once you have your list of problems, prioritize them based on which ones will have the largest impact and what ones excite you the most, and then get cracking on fixing that problem.

## 2. What problems or annoyances do others have?

Similar to the first point but this time see what others are saying. Everyone has a different perspective on things and what might not appear as an issue to you might be an issue for others.

Give social media a browse and keep your eyes and ears open for people mentioning a particular problem or issue. Once you've heard a problem, research it further; is this a one-off? Or, do many people have this problem?

Who knows when you'll hit the jackpot and find the issue everyone has but no one is building for. ü§©

## 3. Question the status-quo

Just because things are the way they are, doesn't mean they need to stay like that forever. We started with steam trains and are now on the precipice of levitating trains and commonplace high-speed rail, who would've thought it back when steam trains were the norm? So, as technology improves, keep challenging and questioning the status quo of products and ideas to see if you can improve on any of them.

In this edition, we covered three methods for finding your next project, do you have any methods I didn't mention? If so, I'd love to hear them so make sure to reply to this email and let's chat. üí¨

I hope you found this edition useful, if you did please consider sharing it on social media so others can find it helpful too. üôè

Until next time, thank you for reading as always.
