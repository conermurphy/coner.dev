Hey Friends ðŸ‘‹

"you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with"; this quote from the successful entrepreneur and author, Jim Rohn has stuck with me over the last few days since reading it for the first time in ["Win Your Inner Battles: Defeat The Enemy Within and Live With Purpose" by Darius Foroux](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Win-Your-Inner-Battles-Purpose-ebook/dp/B013I80LPY).

On the surface, I didn't give it too much thought but then the more and more I thought about it, the more I realized its truth and value in the modern day. In the digital world, it's easier than it has been to spend your time with whoever you please, no longer are you confined to who lives in the 2 or 3 square miles around your home.

If you wanted to, you could spend the majority of your time with people who are halfway around the world and who you have never met in the flesh before. This freedom to choose who we wish to spend our time with empowers us to choose the people we want to be.

Want to be a more positive person? Then spend more time with positive people. Want to be more entrepreneurial? Spend more time with entrepreneurs.

Before reading this quote, I hadn't realized the impact other people can have on our mood and energy levels. But, after reading it and thinking back on my own life, I've noticed how just one or two negative people who choose to see glasses half empty can infect us with their mentality.

Now, while I'm not ruthless enough to cut these people out of my life completely; after all, they are family or friends. I am going to choose to spend less time with them and more time with people who align with the person I wish to become the average of. That is a happier, more ambitious, and more positive person overall.

So, I put the question to you, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and responses via a reply; how have you become the average of the people you spend the most time with? And, how do you want to change that?

As always thank you for reading.
