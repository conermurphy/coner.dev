Hey Friends ðŸ‘‹

As a creator or entrepreneur, it's easy to go tunnel vision on the final goal or complete picture that we're working towards. Whether that be the final version of the product or company you're building or the next milestone for your content and the platform you're on.

But, by doing this it's also easy to lose motivation because often these large goals are also far-reaching ones that take a long time to achieve. So, we need to avoid the loss of motivation and have a plan in place so we can continue working and stay motivated on the way to our large goal.

My favorite way to do this is to split up larger goals into smaller ones that are quicker to achieve. It's even better if it's a small goal that's recurring often as this gives us a repeatable goal we can strive towards without thinking about it.

Content creation is great for this because although our larger goal might be to build an audience of X size or become recognized for a particular type of content in a certain industry or niche, we can focus on creating a new piece of content every week.

So, while our larger goal might take months or even years to achieve, we can stay focused and motivated for it by achieving our weekly goal and carrying the momentum forwards.

Going a long time with no wins or successes is a quick way to lose momentum and motivation; avoid this by breaking up your long-term goals into smaller ones that you can achieve often. ðŸ’ª

As always, thank you for reading.
