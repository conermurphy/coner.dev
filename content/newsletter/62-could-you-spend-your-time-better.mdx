Hey Friends ðŸ‘‹

Are you focusing your efforts on the tasks that produce the most progress toward your goals? Or, are you just spinning your wheels thinking you're going forward but in reality are stationary as a rock?

This last week I've pretty much ditched social media usage from my daily routine and focused completely on building [harken.so](https://harken.so/). At first, I felt guilty for it because internet gurus tell me I need to be on social media constantly marketing and building interest in my new product.

But, after a few days and a hell of a lot of progress made on Harken, I noticed that spending so much time on social media and worrying about how it was doing was a massive detractor from my work and progress with Harken.

While the internet gurus will tell me that spending time marketing and building hype for a product is a beneficial and productive use of my time, it isn't if the product never arrives for people to use it.

So, this made me reflect on the last few weeks and months and how many times I've chosen a path of less resistance. At the time, I thought I was being productive and working towards my goals but in reality, I was skirting responsibility and dodging the real work.

I guess if I had to impart some words of wisdom from this week's edition it would be "always question if the activity you're undertaking is the one best suited to make progress towards your goals. Or, is it just a way of avoiding the real work".

- If you want to build a SaaS product, don't spend all your time marketing it; focus on building it and making it a reality.
- If you want to become an online coach, don't focus on your time on social media; focus on offering your services to clients.

The list goes on and on but the common theme is to make sure you're not spending your time on an activity that isn't the best activity for getting the results you want.

I hope you have a great week next week and I'd love to hear what you're working on so hit reply and let me know. I'd love to chat with you! ðŸ˜„

And, until next week.

Thank you for reading.
