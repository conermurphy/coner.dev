Hey Friends ðŸ‘‹

First of all, I hope you're having a very merry Christmas. ðŸŽ„

It's amazing how quickly the holidays come around each year, it only feels like yesterday I was writing last year's newsletter edition but somehow it's been 52 editions in that time, not one.

Anyway, as this is also the last edition of 2022 ðŸ¤¯, I thought I'd spend the edition looking back at the year gone by and some of the highlights for me personally. Before then covering some goals/targets for 2023, I'd like to work towards.

## 2022 Recap

Although it doesn't necessarily feel like it, this year has been a big year, full of achievements. First of all, I moved from junior frontend developer to a full-stack mid-level developer which was a pretty huge jump for me and one I've loved entirely.

Outside of my full-time work though, it's also been a big year, I took part in my [first hackathon](https://conermurphy.hashnode.dev/squares-github-analytics-made-simple) which while I didn't win; it was a hugely educational and enjoyable experience. Because of that hackathon, I built two SaaS products this year, one free one ([Squares](https://squares.so/)) for the hackathon and one paid/free one which is due to launch very soon ([Harken](https://harken.so/)). These two products were huge achievements because at the start of the year building a SaaS product was always one of those pipe dreams that I thought I'd do one day but never really knew when. But, actually building, deploying, and getting users signed up was an amazing experience and one I look forward to hopefully repeating with Harken and beyond.

Finally, in 2022, I took on more freelance work than I've ever done before which while a bit stressful at times, was overwhelming a great thing. Freelancing and being self-employed have always been a dream of mine and this year I've taken steps to get closer to that.

## Looking Forward To 2023

To be completely honest, I don't have any hard goals concretely defined for 2023 but I will say one thing, it's going to be more of this year and more building!

I want to build more SaaS products. Once Harken is complete, I already have some ideas for the next product I'd like to work on and build; not sure if it has a market but it'll be cool to make nonetheless!

And not even just SaaS products, I want to create more content to help others in the community and try to give back to everyone. This will likely be in the form of blog posts but I'm determined to also make 2023 the year I finally start YouTube after meaning to start it in September. ðŸ˜…

Finally, I'd like to take on more freelancing and self-employment work to help keep the diversification dream alive and well.

## Closing Out

I hope you've had a wonderful Christmas (if you celebrate it) and an even better 2022. I'd love to hear how your 2022 has been, what have you achieved? And, what do you want to achieve in 2023? Reply to this email and let me know. ðŸ˜Š

As always thank you for reading and I look forward to talking to you in 2023 next week! ðŸŽ‰
