Hey Friends üëã

Firstly, I hope you had a wonderful new years celebration for 2022! And, as we enter a new year and look forward to what is to come, what we have planned, and what we aim to achieve in 2023, I thought now would be a good time to talk about an activity I've been trailing weekly for the last three months and found to be a great help.

That activity is personal weekly review sessions. I know it sounds awfully dreary and something that you'd expect in the corporate world which many of us would do anything to not be a part of. But, trust and bare with me for the next few minutes and I'll do my best to explain why they've been so helpful, how I do them, and why you might want to as well. üòÑ

## How They Help ü§ù

It's okay to say I want to achieve X, Y, or Z goals in a certain time frame whether that be a month, quarter, or year. But, unless you have something or someone keeping you accountable to those goals and making you plan a strategy to achieve them, actually achieving them can be a mountainous task.

Now, a mentor or coach would be a great solution to this problem but they can be quite costly and not everyone has the spare cash to afford to pay for one or have the network to find one that works for them. So, it's left to us to find a solution to the problem.

This is exactly where the weekly review session comes in. Suddenly each week we can be our own mentor or coach and review what we did, the progress we made, and the mistakes we fell into and offer words of wisdom to help improve the following week.

I won't pretend this is a crazy easy thing to do, it does take some time to do each week 30-60 minutes each Sunday and it does require a healthy dose of self-discipline to see through and get the benefits from. But, if you invest in it and give it time, the investment pays off, goals get achieved, and progress gets made! üöÄ

## How I Do A Weekly Review üìÖ

Of course, with anything like this, it is a highly customizable process and that's something I'd 100% encourage you to do. Take my template and initial layout below and try it out, remove what doesn't work, and add in what you think will work. Ultimately, you want to build the best review template to help you achieve your goals and not someone else's.

Anyway, with that all said and out of the way, here is my weekly review template/sections.

**Task/Idea Dump:** This is a list in which I dump all of the tasks or ideas I currently have in mind so I have an empty mind for the rest of the review.

**Did you achieve this week's goals?:** I copy over the goals from the previous week's review and add a ‚úÖ or ‚ùå for whether the goal was achieved or not.

**Week Recap and Evaluation:** In this section, I add some comments on the above list. Things that went well and not so well that might have contributed to goals being achieved or not. This provides me with a space to remember things that I want to repeat in the future.

**Favorite thing about this week?:** As it says on the tin really, just one or two lines about your favorite thing from that week. It's good to remember the good times and remain positive each week.

**Goals for next week:** After reviewing the previous week, I spend some time looking at the week ahead. I choose three goals tasks/goals that I want to achieve that week to make progress towards my larger/longer goals.

**Progress recap toward current goals:** I list out all of my larger goals for the month/quarter/year and add a line or two recaps about how progress is being made toward that goal and if not, what I could change to get it back on track.

**Next steps for goals:** Similar to the section above but instead of an overall progress report, this is a breakdown of the next steps/tasks that need to be completed to make progress.

## Closing Thoughts ü§î

Doing weekly reviews has been a great help to me over the last three months of 2022 and I hope they'll also be a help to you in 2023 if you haven't done them before and are now just starting. I'd love to hear what goals you have planned for 2023 and how weekly reviews could help you achieve them.

I hope you have a prosperous 2023!

As always, thank you for reading.

Until next time.
