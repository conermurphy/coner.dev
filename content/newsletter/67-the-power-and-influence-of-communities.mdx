Hey Friends üëã

Being in a community of like-minded people pursuing similar goals comes with many perks and benefits and this fact is widely accepted as true and taken as so. However, at least for me, I never really felt like I experienced many of these perks or benefits besides making a few friends and seeing what cool things people got up to.

But, that all changed this last week because as you may recall from the last edition of the newsletter, I recently launched [Harken](https://harken.so/), a Spotify-SaaS to help you find songs and playlists you thought you lost. Now, not only did being part of the tech-Twitter community allow me to beta test Harken with a small group of individuals I'm friends with, but it also allowed me to get some brutally honest feedback and for that I'm thankful. üôè

That feedback was regarding the pricing of Harken, all the people I spoke with said it was overpriced (or similar), saying things like "I can see the value but wouldn't personally pay for it".

As a result of that feedback, I'm going back to the drawing board and readjusting the pricing of Harken to make it a more attractive proposition for everyone and anyone who uses Spotify.

But, besides what I'm doing with Harken and how the feedback and testing have helped shape the product, it shows how important a community of trusted like-minded people is to have around you.

Without joining this community and fostering relationships with the people in it, it would've taken me a lot longer to get this feedback (if ever) and even longer to make the changes and try course correct the product!

Now, I don't want to make it sound like joining a community is the only way you can build a successful product or be successful in your pursuits and goals. But, what I will say is it makes it a hell of a lot easier to do!

So, I'd love to hear how joining a community or fostering relationships with people has helped you improve a product or achieve your goals. If you'd like to share, please reply to this email and let me know. üì©

And, as always, thank you for reading.
