Hey Friends ðŸ‘‹

Have you ever had one of those weeks where you feel like you've done loads but also feel like you've achieved little? Yeah, that was me this week.

Overall, it's been a pretty reactive week since my original plan fell to bits. But, luckily tomorrow is Monday and that means a fresh opportunity to attack our goals! ðŸ’ª

So, something I wanted to talk about today was a new productivity trick/practice/hack (dare I say ðŸ˜…) that I'm trialing this coming week. For the last few days, I've been reading [Eat That Frog! by Brian Tracy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eat-That-Frog-Important-Things/dp/1444765426), and one of the common themes is attacking the most important, most beneficial, and most valuable task first thing in the morning.

Basically, before the day gets in your way, you want to commit to and complete the task for that day that will drive you towards your goals the most; your most valuable task!

However, while I'm going to be trying that out this week, I wanted to take it one step further. Doing your most valuable task each day is all well and good but first, you need to know what your most valuable task is. If you don't know that bit of information then the whole plan kinda falls on its face.

So, to make sure I'm not relying on my future (more procrastinating) self to make these decisions where I'll typically pick the easiest task to fool me into thinking I'm being productive. (Or, to make sure I achieve my Todoist goals. ðŸ¤£) I'm instead planning out each day's most valuable task for the week ahead in my weekly review session so that when the day comes no decision-making is needed and it's just all action!

If you want to do this yourself, there's not much needed. I'm doing mine in my task app which is Todoist as mentioned but you could do this in whatever you want to really. Basically, for each day of the week, write down or denote the most valuable task for the day, I've assigned mine as "priority 1" for example. And, that's it! Now, just crush those tasks each day.

I'm excited to see how this new system will play out and if it'll have much of an impact so I look forward to reporting back in next week's edition on how it went. Will you also be trialing this system? Let me know by replying to this email. ðŸ’Œ

And, as always, thank you for reading, and until next time.

Coner x
