# What’s the Right Platform for Your Website? Here’s How to Find Out.
## Choosing the Right Platform for Your next Site Doesn’t Need to Be Hard.

Setting up a website may seem like a daunting prospect for the uninitiated and if it was ten years ago, I’d agree with you. But, truth is creating your own website is no longer a task just for the web-developers. Instead, it’s something we can all do from the comfort of our living room.

Once you’ve decided you’re going to make a website and you know the subject of it, you’re halfway there. All you need to do is decide on the platform you’re going to use. And, today, that’s what I’m going to help you decide.

There’s plenty of options available from CMS’s (Content Management System) like Wordpress to SSG’s (Static Site Generator) like Gatsby and we’re going to cover them and everything in between to help you decide which platform is right for your website.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";

alert(s);

const this = "this is a code example";
```

### Available Platforms

There’s plenty of options available to you but before we dive in and look at each platform we need to look at the bigger picture and understand a few facts about your website. So, before carrying on answer these questions:

1. What features do you want your website to have? Blog? Shop? Multiple Users? Easy to use UI?
2. How experienced are you with code? / Are you willing to learn a coding language?
3. Are you going to maintain and host the website yourself? Or, outsource?
4. What’s your budget?

Depending on your answers to these questions some platforms will be more suited to you than others.

For example:

- If you are happy to learn how to code and only want a blog on your website with a homepage then I’d recommend an SSG like GatsbyJS.

However,

- If you wanted a shop, with minimal coding involved and didn’t want to host or maintain the website then Squarespace would be a good option.

But, that’s enough hypotheticals, let’s get into the meat of this post and actually talk about different platforms, what they’re good and bad at and who they’re suited to.

Also, as a side-note, I will mostly be avoiding the topic of speed and website load times as while they’re a very important issue there are a lot of variables that play into this besides the platform.

#### Wordpress

*(I’m only discussing Wordpress.org in this article but there is another option Wordpress.com. Essentially wordpress.org is the self-hosted version where you’re responsible for updating software, adding themes and plugins and making sure it works while .com is the version of Wordpress where they host and maintain the site for you, so you just build the frontend.)*

There’s no better place to start than one of the largest and well known CMS platforms in existence, Wordpress currently powers 34% of the internet* and that number doesn’t seem to be slowing down.

And, as you would expect with a statistic like that it’s very well supported. You’ll struggle to find a hosting provider that doesn’t support Wordpress. Furthermore, the community is one of the largest of any platform so someone is always there to help.

Another great reason to go with Wordpress is its flexibility. Wordpress has one of if not the largest selection of themes and plugins available to it’s users and here are some more things you can do with Wordpress:

- Shops
- Forums
- Blogging
- Fundraising
- Support / Live Chat

But, before you go running into this rose garden there are some thorns to consider. Wordpress can be expensive but, it depends on what you need. For example, hosting can be found for as cheap as £6/month but can also cost £100’s/month, themes are normally £50 once-off and premium plugins while not necessary can be really helpful and there going to cost you £10/20 each.

Then we have support to discuss if you want support past the initial period most themes will cost you £30/year.

And, this is before we even consider employing a developer which could cost hundreds if not thousands.

To summarise, Wordpress is a great tool for building some amazing websites that range from the simple to the elaborate. But, if you’re considering a complex website with custom features I’d get ready to open your chequebook or roll up your sleeves.

#### Squarespace

In recent years, Squarespace has made a name for itself for being easy to use, no coding skills required platform that they support for you and to be fair, I’d say this is accurate.

When you take out a plan with Squarespace (see image below) they offer 24/7 customer support on all plans so you can contact them any time with any questions and they should be able to help you out.

And, while we’re on the topic of pricing, there’s only one monthly fee to worry about, none of this buy a theme here, plugin there and a host to wrap it all together stuff you have to do with Wordpress. No, Squarespace offers all of their features, support and themes in one monthly payment.

Following this trend of simplicity, they offer an easy to use drag and drop builder that doesn’t require a line of code. They’ve made it so someone with zero website development skills can pick it up, play with it and come out with a decent looking website with features like a blog and a store all without needing years of experience.

However, while it is easy to use, if you’re looking for a feature and it’s not included in Squarespace’s list, you’re out of luck as no custom tools are supported so it can be quite limiting.

Overall, Squarespace is a great option for those who are looking for a website builder that requires no coding and no knowledge of website development, hosting or maintenance. Although I’m not sure how much cheaper Squarespace will be in the long run compared to Wordpress or other platforms then simplicity does come with a price.

#### Ghost

Ghost while not as popular as Wordpress or Squarespace is still a well supported and ever-growing platform that has come to light in the last few years. If you’re considering blogging as your primary use then Ghost is a very valid option.

The guys behind Ghost went back to basics, building a platform from the ground up that does one thing fantastically rather than many things half as well.

When you look at other options like Squarespace and Wordpress they do many different things ranging from shops to forums and everything in between, which is great but that much bloat comes with a trade-off mainly in the form of extra cost and speed.

Ghost is a basic CMS that handles markdown files for blogging. It gives the user a GUI to interface with and has plenty of relevant features like Users with different roles, integration with social media and automation apps like Zapier among other things.

Ghost comes in two varieties the self-hosted version which can be installed on any computer even relatively low spec ones all the way up to web servers and ran from home. And, then they offer Ghost Pro which is a monthly fee you pay the developers of the application and they host it for you so you don’t need to worry about updates or maintenance.

And, I know you might be saying “this sounds like Wordpress” but hold up. With Wordpress, there’s plenty of things to gain by going self-hosted but with Ghost, the only real benefit I could find of going self-hosted is a reduction in cost, everything else stays the same.

Simply, Ghost is for those who aren’t interested in learning code or running a store or forum but instead want something that handles a blog fantastically and Ghost could be that solution.

#### SSG (GatsbyJS)

SSG’s or Static Site Generators are the new kids on the block when it comes to website platforms. Now I won’t discuss every single one as there are quite a few (if you’re interested, you can see a list here). But, instead, I’m going to talk about the one I have the most experience with which is GatsbyJS.

Now, SSG’s and GatsbyJS more specifically has gained a lot of traction lately because of how fast it loads pages and I know I said I wouldn’t discuss speed or load times in this post but with GatsbyJS it would be a crime not mentioning it.

Basically, GatsbyJS makes static pages compared to dynamic pages so it can load all of the content for the entire website in one server call as opposed to a call to the server every time you load a new page which means navigating around the website is instant, no load times at all, just check out there website to see how quick it is.

Out of the box GatsbyJS has been designed to do static websites like blogs and other pages that don’t require dynamic parts like shops, forums and so on. That isn’t to say they’re not possible in GatsbyJS, just there’s probably a better platform for it.

Although all of these benefits do come with some drawbacks like there is no GUI for gatsby development. If you want to make a site with GatsbyJS then you better be comfortable with code or be prepared to learn it. More specifically these are the languages I had to learn:

- Javascript
- ReactJS
- CSS
- HTML
- GraphQL

It’s a lot to take in.

I’ve found it quite a challenge to build a semi-decent website and I came in with a fairly good understanding of HTML and CSS with some basic knowledge of Javascript so for a complete novice it might not be the best choice unless you like a challenge.

However, it ain’t all bad news, GatsbyJS is the only one on this list you can host completely for free. Companies like Netlify let you host your static site for free with a free SSL certificate and other nice benefits.

But, with this, all said and done. Is GatsbyJS for everyone? No. Unless you already know the languages or want to pay for a developer / dedicate time to learning the code and making your site then GatsbyJS and other SSG’s are probably not the best options.

### Which Is Right for You

It’s hard to answer this question without knowing individual circumstances so instead, I’m going to list some scenarios and what platform I think is best for each.

- Cheap, No code required, Mainly blogging > Ghost
- Flexible, Little code, Happy to maintain yourself, lots of support > Wordpress
- Simple, No code, Constant Support, Easy to set up, flexible > Squarespace
- Happy to code, Speed is essential, Free, Mainly Blogging or Informing > GatsbyJS

Now, your circumstances may fall somewhere in the middle of two or three of these scenarios. And, if you do then think about the questions I asked at the beginning and also think not where your website will be when you launch but rather where you want it to be in 5 years time.

For example, It’s a lot easier to add a shop later on if you plan for it now and choose a platform that can support that, rather than selecting what meets your needs now and needing to change platforms later on (which is a pain).

### My Experience

I’ve personally used all of the options in this list for varying amounts of time, although I’m currently only working with GatsbyJS on my website which while challenging is proving to be rewarding.

Beyond that, I’ve used Wordpress for the longest amount of time but that was mainly because I was comfortable with it and didn’t want to explore other available options on the market.

Then, I’ve used Squarespace and Ghost for the least amount of time but they’re both still great options if they fit your needs.

### Wrapping Up

To round up, there’s plenty of options out there on the market and I haven’t even got close to listing them here, these ones are just the most popular on the market / the one I have enough experience to discuss.

But, before you commit to any platform make sure you understand what you want out of your website both now and in the future, so you avoid the headache of switching platforms with a mature site.

Hopefully, I’ve helped you decide which platform is right for you. If so, which one and why?
