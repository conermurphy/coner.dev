### My Personal Website Portfolio

Being the first website I've built using a bunch of new languages and technologies, such as:

* Javascript
* ReactJS
* GraphQL
* GatsbyJS
* NPM / Node

It has been a challenge but utimaltely it's been a challenge I'm happy I undertook. It hasn't been easy by any stretch of the imagination, there's been plently of times I've been pulling my hair out and stressing over one small part not working but that is why this project is possibly more unique and special to me than any other could be. 

This project is the starting line to my marathon of web development, this project isn't the pinnacle of web development, there's better looking sites out there with smoother animations, better design and more. But, I'll get there and this website, my website is only the starting line.

As the saying goes:

> Don't compare your chapter one to someone else's chapter twenty.

So, I welcome you to my new website and the journey that follows, I hope you'll stick around.

On this website you'll find all the work I complete in the **Projects** section like this one and then in the **Writing** seciton you'll find any posts I write that seem revelant to this site or my journey in some way.
