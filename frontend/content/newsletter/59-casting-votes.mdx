Hey Friends ðŸ‘‹

Don't worry this edition won't be talking about any recent election results or anything like that. Instead, I want to talk about casting votes for ourselves. Casting votes for the person we wish to become and the habits and rituals we wish to build.

To quote one of my favorite books that discusses this concept, [**Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones** by **James Clear**.](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)

> "Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity."

At the start of a journey, it doesn't matter how you cast your vote as long as you cast it. If you want to become the type of person who exercises daily? Then don't focus on lofty goals like running a 5km race daily at the start; instead, set your sights small and do a 5-minute run around the block. Although it's small and doesn't feel like much, you're casting that all-important vote for the person you want to become!

This doesn't just apply to health and fitness either. You can apply it to anything, even being a creator or entrepreneur.

Want to become a content creator? Start by spending 5 minutes per day working on a bit of content you want to publish; that's enough to cast your vote and start your journey. Same for being an entrepreneur, just spend a few minutes per day working on a new business idea.

As you cast your votes and you slowly transform into the person you want to become, you can increase the duration and push yourself harder towards your goals. But, at the start, it all starts the same, you casting votes for who you want to be!

I'd love to hear how and what you're casting your votes for now. Let me know by replying to this email. ðŸ’Œ

And, as always, thank you for reading.
