Hey Friends ðŸ‘‹

I, like many I'm sure, go through spurts of productivity and working towards the things we say we will. For me, one of the biggest goals and tasks I set for myself is content creation, whether that be on YouTube, on social media, or as a blog post. The issue is it's all too common for me to tell myself that "I don't have the time" to do those things and that I need to carve out some magical block of time to be able to work towards those goals.

And, do you know what that ends up as? Absolutely nothing achieved or created. I went through a period of 3 months late last year where I told myself the exact things above and besides this newsletter, I made maybe one or two blog posts which is hardly impressive.

But, a funny thing happened this week, I still told myself that I didn't have the time or I wasn't sure where I could find the time. However, instead of pushing the task and not achieving anything, I just said "screw it" and gave the task a shot to see how far I would get with it in that sitting.

And, do you know what happened?

I wrote, edited, and published two blog posts in three days! A monumental increase over my efforts from the end of last year and it just goes to show that sometimes you just need to say "screw it" and see how far you get with a task instead of just writing it off and waiting for another day.

So, I'm curious to know what tasks you will say "screw it" to this week? Let me know by replying to this email. ðŸ“§

And, as always, thank you for reading.
