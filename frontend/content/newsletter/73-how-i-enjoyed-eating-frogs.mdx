Hey Friends üëã

As promised last week, this week's edition will be a roundup and review of the last week and how it went using the "Eat That Frog" method of task planning and completion.

I'll go into more detail but the TLDR is it works and works very well! üî•

For those who didn't catch last week's edition; last Sunday I planned out for the entire week each day's most important task, the task that had the most value to me and my projects. And, as I sit here writing this, all of those tasks have been completed and in some places like content creation, I've progressed beyond the original tasks required. ü§©

Now, I'm not sure why this method works so well, whether it's because it clarifies your goals for the day and removes any ambiguity around your work or if it's something else. But what I do know is that this last week has been a very productive one and I've made progress on goals that I have previously been putting off for weeks and months like recording my first YouTube channel video (published soon). üëÄ

So, because of how this week went, I've already gone ahead and planned out my most important tasks for this coming week and it's something I can see myself doing for many weeks and months to come because without a doubt it has made a big difference. On the surface, it may seem a small change to your day and may even be something that we do subconsciously but I found when you attach a label to a task to denote its importance and you plan that ahead of time, it gives you an almost laser-like focus on achieving that task and getting it done!

Have you previously tried out the "Eat That Frog" method? If so, I'd love to hear your experience with the method and what your thoughts are on it. If you'd like to share, please hit reply and send me an email. ‚úâÔ∏è

I hope you have a productive and joy-filled week next week.

And, as always, thank you for reading.
