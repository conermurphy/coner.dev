It's well known that if you want to increase the amount of traffic your blog posts receieve you should be cross-posting them to other platforms. But, there is one crucial thing you need to ensure you do to make sure you're not putting all those extra impressions to waste.

## Personal Domain

Before we look at cross posting, it's pivotal that you have your blog posts being hosted on your own domain. This doesn't need to be a custom built site, it could be a Medium or Hashnode blog but just make sure you're using your own domain name.

If you're new to buying your own domain, my goto place and where I recommend for buying them is [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/), they're consistently one of the cheapest places to buy domains and offer a wide selection of TLD's (Top Level Domains) to choose from.

### Why it matters?

Why is it so pivotal to have all your posts on your own domain? One word (or rather three letters), SEO! By having all your blog posts on your own domain, search engines will crawl these posts and start building a profile on your domain. Over time, if your posts get a lot of traffic, search engines will start listing your domain higher in search results in turn bringing you even more views.

Once you have this profile built up, if your so inclined, you can start thinking about making some money off all your hard work. Now, this could ad revuenve from hosting Google Ads on your site or it could be using your impressions to attract sponsors or guest blogging spots, the options are endless. But, what enabled all of this? The profile and domain authority you built from your posts being on your domain.

The alternative is all your articles get published under the domain of one of the big blogging platforms and they get all of the SEO goodness and you miss out. ðŸ‘Ž

## Cross-Posting

Now, we've established that blogging on your own domain is pivotal to the growth of your blog, let's talk about cross-posting.

Cross-Posting is a great way to get extra eyes on your hard work, there is one big gotcha to cross-posting which I'll cover later on in this post. But, first let's cover the best places to cross-post.

### Medium

[Medium.com](medium.com/) is one of the biggest names in the blogging world, it's a platform that allows you to create a blog and post for others to read.

There is a couple of ways to get your post noticed on Medium:

1. Adding tags to your posts. You can add upto 5 tags per post by tagging your post it will show up in searches on the site.
2. Posting it in a publication. Publications are like a digital newspaper, they allow you to submit a post to be published under their name with you credited as the author. This is a good stratergy because they likely already have a large following built up and by publishing in the publication it immediately get's put in front of these followers.

### DEV

[DEV](https://dev.to/) is another blogging platform like Medium but geared more towards developers.

Overall, DEV has a smaller total readership than Medium but because the site is tailored towards developers the concentration of people likely to be interested in your article is going to be similar to or more than Medium making DEV a great candidate for cross-posting.

Similar to Medium you can also add tags to your blog posts upto a limit of 4 per post to allow your posts to show up in search results. DEV also has communities which are similar to publications on Medium but from my experience at least seem to be less widely used.

### Hashnode

The final place to cross-post your blog post is [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/).

Hashnode is the newest platform in this list but that doesn't make it any less important. Hashnode has grown very quick and has become an staple for blogging in the developer world, making it a great candidate for cross-posting.

Similar to both Medium and DEV it also allows you to add tags to your blog posts upto a limit of 5. You can also submit your posts to other publications like the others.

## Avoiding SEO Disaster

You can cross-post to all of the above platforms or just one of them but no matter how many platforms you choose to cross-post to, you'll need to make sure you always set the **Canonical URL**.

I won't go into detail on Canonical URLs here (if you're interested [Google has a great page on it here](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/consolidate-duplicate-urls)) but the upshot of Canonical URLs is that they tell search engines where the original source of this content is located.

Essentially, what this means for us is that we can cross-post our posts onto these other blogging platforms and still get all of the SEO goodness pointed back to our original post on our actual domain name. This means that our original post on our domain name is seen by search engines as the source the other posts came from so it pushes our original post and by extension our domain up in ranking.

Here is how to set a Canonical URL on each of the above platforms:

- Medium : https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033930293-Set-a-canonical-link
- DEV : https://dev.to/p/editor_guide
- Hashnode : When writing an article goto settings and add the URL to the Original URL field.

## Summary

It's good to cross post your posts to other sites to gain traction and increase your impressions but you need to make sure it's done in the correct way with Canonical URLs to ensure you get all of the SEO bonuses and not the platforms you cross-post to.
