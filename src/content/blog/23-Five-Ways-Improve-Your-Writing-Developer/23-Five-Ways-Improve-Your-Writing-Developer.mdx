Writing high-quality technical content is a big enough challenge on it's own, once we add in the challenge of ensuring our writing and English is correct it becomes an even larger challenge. For some this is enough for them to put off publishing content but it shouldn't be!

In this post I'll be sharing five ways you can improve your writing to ensure you convey your next technical article perfectly.

## Grammarly

Grammarly is an amazing tool for checking your writing. There are two versions, a free version and a paid version. Personally, for just checking emails, blog posts and tweets I think the free version is adequete enough. The paid version does offer more features such as: Conciseness, Readability, Word choice and Fluency but for just ensuring your writing is free from spelling and grammatical errors the free version is fine.

If you're interested in [checking out Grammarly you can do so here](https://www.grammarly.com/plans).

## Hemingway Editor

The Hemingway Editor (named after the famous author Ernest Hemingway) allows you to check your writing for style errors. It's aim is to improve the writer's message and allow readers to focus on it easier. It does this by highlighting your body of writing in various colours, each signifying something different and an area you can improve.

This editor is completely free to [use online here](https://hemingwayapp.com/) but there is also a desktop app you [can purchase here](https://hemingwayapp.com/desktop.html) should you be interested.

## Forest

Forest, isn't a writing aid like Grammarly and the Hemingway Editor are. Instead, Forest is a mobile app and browser extensions that aims to make you focus on your work more by removing distractions from your phone. It also works as a kind of Pomodoro timer, if you're unfamilar with a Pomodoro timer, it's a tool that allows you to implement the Pomodoro technique which is working in blocks of time followed by periods of rest. Normally, 25 minutes work to 5 minutes rest. The idea being this helps increase your focus and get more work done.

Why will this improve your writing? Personally, I can get easily distracted from writing an article. By using Forest it helps me stay on topic and focused on the task at hand which in turns helps me write more.

## Pick up a book

One of the best ways to improve your writing, isn't actually to write at all. It's to read other people's writing. I highly recommened reading as a daily activity in general but improving your writing is a great reason to pick up a book. It doesn't need to be a computer science book or even anything related to the world of coding. It could be non-fiction or a politics book, pick something that interests you and get pulled into it.

Reading other people's writing, is like reading other people's code. It helps expose us to new concepts, ideas and words we haven't seen before which by extension will give us a larger vocabulary and experience to call upon when writing.

## Practise!

Finally, one of the best ways to improve your writing is to write! Just like coding, photography or drawing at first we're likely not going to going to be great at it. But, with time and experience our skills will improve and so will our writing. Make a daily goal of writing 750 words by completing the [Morning Pages project](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/) or by writing a blog post a day. It doesn't matter what you're writing but the important part is the writing, the content can always be added in.

## Summary / How I Work.

These where five ways to improve your writing as a developer. To conclude I wanted to share my process for writing a blog post and how I implement these five methods in my own life.

When I write an article, I make a point of doing as little editing as possible while I write. I always try to seperate out writing and editing so while I'm writing the article I can just focus on getting the content out. This includes things like correcting spelling mistakes I notice, I even go as far as writing all my posts in VSCode with no spell checking so my attention is taken away from the writing.

After I've finished writing the article I'll take a break, ideally at least one whole day before returning to the post. This isn't always possible so at minimum I'll do a few hours. This is so I can return to it with a clear mind and a different mindset from when I was writing. Anyway, when I do sit down to edit the post, I paste the entire article into the Hemingway Editor with the Grammarly browser extension installed. I first work through all of the Grammarly issues like spelling issues and then turn my attention to the issues the Hemingway Editor is giving me.

Once I've fixed all of these issues, I'll give the final piece a read through to make sure it still flows correctly and I haven't lost the purpose of the article while editing it. Then it's just a matter of creating images and scheduling the post.

Thanks for reading! Do you have any tips to help people improve their writing? If so, be sure to share them with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrConerMurphy). If you found this post helpful, please consider sharing it for others to see.
