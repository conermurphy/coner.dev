While upgrading my website I also wanted to upgrade the NodeJS version. The current one I was using was having its support removed.

This led me down the journey of finding out how to upgrade NodeJS. There seemed to be many ways you can tackle this problem. But the best method I found is using [NVM or Node Version Manager.](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

In this post, we'll look at using NVM to install multiple NodeJS versions and to switch between them at the drop of a hat.

## Installing NVM

To install NVM it's as simple as running the authors install script which you can find [here.](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/v0.38.0/install.sh) You can either paste this into your terminal or you can run one of the below `curl` or `wget` commands to do it for you:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash

wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
```

After running this script, you should notice the NVM repository has been copied into a `~/.nvm` folder. Following this, the below code should now be added to your current terminal profile.

For example, I use ZSH for my terminal which is located in the directory `~/.zshrc`. After installing NVM I would find the below code copied into that file.

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

That's it! NVM should now be installed on your machine.

## Using NVM

Using NVM is simple, let's take a look at some of the most common commands you'll use in it:

### Installing a New NodeJS Version

To install a new NodeJS version, you can use one of the below commands.

To get the latest version you can run:

```bash
nvm install node # "node" is an alias for the latest version
```

Or, if you have a particular version in mind that you want to install:

```bash
nvm install 14.8.0 # or 10.10.0, 8.9.1, etc
```

_NOTE: The first version you install becomes the default that new shell windows will use._

### Checking Installed NodeJS Versions

If you want to check what versions of Node you have installed you can run:

```bash
nvm ls
```

### Checking What NodeJS Versions Can Be installed.

If you're interested in seeing what versions you can install using NVM, you can run:

```bash
nvm ls-remote
```

### Switching NodeJS Versions

To switch between versions you can use:

```bash
nvm use 14.8.0 # or 10.10.0, 8.9.1, etc
```

### Uninstalling Old NodeJS Versions

If you want to uninstall a version of Node you no longer need:

```bash
nvm uninstall 14.8.0 # or 10.10.0, 8.9.1, etc
```

## Troubleshooting

If you were like me and run into the error nvm: command not found every time you try to run one of these commands. Or, you have another issue you can check out the troubleshooting section on the [NVM Github Repo.](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#additional-notes)

Unfortunately, my issue wasn't on the troubleshooting section so I had to do some digging. Here's how I solved it.

After retracing my steps, I found that the original install script hadn't added the below code to my `~/.zshrc`.

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

After I opened my `~/.zshrc` file and dropped in that code at the bottom NVM started to work. If you're getting the `nvm: command not found` error try the troubleshooting guide first. If that doesn't help, check it was installed correctly.

If neither of these work I would recommend opening an issue on GitHub for some support.

## Conclusion

That's it! NVM should now be installed and you should be able to install and use as many NodeJS versions as you please.
