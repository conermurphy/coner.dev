Being productive is more than just getting work done. Being truly productive is using our time to it's maximum potential. By increasing our productivity we are increasing the return we get related to the amount of effort we put in.

For this reason, to ensure we stay on target and are always using our time as efficently and productivly as possible we may need assisstance. In this post, I've complied three of my favourite apps that boost our productivity and ensure we stay efficent throughout the day.

## Todoist

Todoist is a to-do list app that in my opinion is unmatched. I've tried countless methods of tracking my tasks and to-do lists but no app or method has come close to Todoist.

I tried the classic pen and paper method but found I didn't always have it on me so would miss some tasks leading to reduced productivity. I then tried moving my task lists to another one of my favourite apps, Notion. But, I found that while Notion is great for some things being a everyday todo list isn't one of them. As a whole I found that Notion is to slow to be a task list.

Todoist doesn't suffer from these issues. It's always with me as it's my phone and it's ridiculously quick so I can add tasks as soon as I think of them. Following this, because Todoist are only focused on being a great todo list app, the UI has been designed to enable a great experience for managing your lists.

Overall, I will be using Todoist for a long time. If you're interested, you can [check them out here.](https://todoist.com/)

## Notion

While I said Notion isn't great for managing todo lists, it's great for managing other things. If you need to track projects, content creation or other things that aren't as simple as a todo list then Notion will have you covered.

I use Notion for tracking all of my content and projects. So, if I come up with a blog post idea it's immediately added to Notion and then I use a Kanban board to progress all the posts through from concept to complete. I also repeat this for projects.

Notion can also be used for almost anything, part of it's attractiveness is it's flexibility. If you can dream it up, then you can likely make it in Notion. I won't cover all of it's features here but I highly recommened [checking it out.](notion.so/)

## Forest

The final app on this list, isn't a todo list or a way of organising your projects and life.

Instead, it's a way to ensure you stay focused and on topic for a period of time. It forces you to be productive.

Forest is a great app that I've been using for years. It helps you implement the Pomodoro technique which if you haven't heard of is essentially the idea that we work best in small sprints followed by rests. The standard period of time is 25 minutes of work followed by 5 minutes of rest, repeated 2/3 times before taking a longer period of rest such as 15 minutes.

What Forest does do is actually go one step further. It's not just a simple timer like you could do with the timer built into your phone. No, it actually goes to the extent of completing locking you out of using your phone. If you try to close the Forest app and open another it will forciably close the app you opened and return you to Forest until the timer finishes. Don't think you're slacking off on Twitter anymore!

Also, did I mention that if you sign up to the pro version they actually plant trees to help save actual forests! [Check them out here.](https://www.forestapp.cc/)

## How I use these apps

While it's great having these 3 apps on your phone / PC, that's not enough. What we really need to do is optimise them and our use of them to ensure we maximise our productivity.

Here's a brief overview of how I use these apps in my daily workflow.

As mentioned earlier on, all my tasks are in Todoist and my projects / content are in Notion. So what I do is a daily review, every morning I will go through my tasks on Todoist check which ones have been completed and add any that are the next logical step.

For example, if I had a task to write a blog post which I've completed I will immediately create a new task to edit that blog post.

Now, this isn't possible for all tasks as you may not know what will come next but whenever I can I always make sure to add the next task when I complete one. The less in my head the better because our minds make for really bad filling cabinets.

As a rule of thumb I will try not to use due dates unless it can't be done until that date. For example, if I had a task to take the car for a service I can't do it until the date of the service so the task will be dated for then. But, in the case of editing a blog post it's not dependent on a date so I will add it with no due date and instead use a priority indicator.

This allows me to see all of my tasks in one list in order of their priorities. I can then target the highest priorities first which should yeild the highest returns.

After updating my Todoist, I set about updating and reviewing my Notion. As mentioned I use Notion for my projects and content, so it's pretty quick to update especially using Kanban boards. Once I've checked all the blog posts and projects are in the correct status, I then check to see if I can add any more tasks to my Todoist. So if a blog is in the writing status, do I have a task to complete the post?

It may seem like a lot of work managing the two apps. But, once you get setup and get in a flow, you find that you check Notion once per day at most sometimes less if you know things haven't moved and then pretty much run your life from Todoist.

Finally, I don't have a dedicated time I use Forest. It's just something that I use as and when I'm working on tasks that need my full attention like writing or editing a blog post. I don't use it for every task I'm working on but for tasks that requiring complete attenion it's great.

## Summing Up

These are the current apps I use the most while working and in my endless pursuit of increased productivity. I won't pretend that my system or these apps are the perfect solution for everyone. What's more important is the system you implement not the apps you use in the system. In the pursuit of increased productivity, we learn a lot about ourselves and how we like to work, take this information and build a system that works to you and your life.
