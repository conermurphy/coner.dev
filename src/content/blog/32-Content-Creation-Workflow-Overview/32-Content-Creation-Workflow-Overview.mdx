Regularly creating content online is one of the best ways to grow an audience and increase your prospects online while also allowing you to solidify your knowledge and help others improve. It really is a win-win and there's not many reasons why you shouldn't do it.

If you're interested in starting to create content online but not sure what to do, how to do it or where to begin with it then this blog post will hopefully help you out. In this post I want to cover how I create content online and the workflow I use to create it.

Let's get started.

## Blog Posts

A big part of the content I create is my blog posts. I aim to produce 2/week, one on a Wednesday and one on a Saturday. There's no set format for what I will create in each, some weeks they will both be long tutorial posts and other weeks they will be shorter quick blog posts discussing a new topic I've come across.

While my blog is for others to use, reference and learn from. It's also an important place for me to document my knowledge and solutions to problems I've come across so I can quickly find a solution again in the future.

Anyway, let's now take a deeper look into how I create blog posts.

### The Life of a Post

I'm a big fan of Notion for managing my posts. I often have several posts on the go at once, all at various different stages of production so having a central location where I can manage all of the posts is key.

In my case, I heavily use Kanban boards for my content but especially so for my blog posts, below is a screenshot of my current Notion page so you can see how I organise my posts.

// Insert image of notion blog post page here.

I have seven categories that I move posts between:

- No Status
- Outlining
- Creating
- Editing
- Scheduled
- Cross-Posting
- Published

When I get a new idea I create a new card in the 'No Status' category so I have a back log of ideas to work from. Then as I work on them and the post progresses, it moves to the right until eventually it ends up in the 'Published' category.

Let's take a more in depth look at the main stages.

### Writing

Once I have an idea, it goes into the 'No Status' category, then once I start working on the post, have decided on the sections within the post and have fleshed out the ideas it moves into the Outlining category.

Following this, it ends up in the first big section which is the writing section. This is where it will spend most of it's time.

I try to write all of my posts in one sitting, once I'm in the zone for writing I don't want to break it. Occasionally I will take a break and come back to it especially if it's a long post that is a few thousand words but for smaller posts I try to do it in one sitting.

The one thing I avoid at all costs doing is editing while writing. Some people will dwell on one sentence and keep re-writing it until it's perfect. I try to avoid doing this as much as possible because it slows down the process of writing the post and takes me out of the writing zone.

I write all of my posts in MDX within VS Code, while it's not a full fledged writing editor like MS Word or Google Docs I actually think this plays to my benefit because when you use a fully fledged writing editor you're constantly reminded of spelling or grammatical errors that draw your attention away from writing anf towards editing which is what I'm trying to avoid.

Once I've finished writing the post, I then move to the editing phase.

### Editing

There's two tools I use heavily when it comes to editing blog posts.

1. Hemingway Editor
2. Grammarly

You can use these individually on their respective web editors but what I prefer doing is installing the Grammarly browser extension and putting my article into the Hemingway Editor which works amazing with the Grammarly extension.

This allows me to get the benefits of both in one editor and not having to back and forth between serveral places.

When it comes to acutally doing the edits, I first run a development version of my website to see the new blog post on the website. Then I copy and paste the article over to the Hemingway Editor where I complete the bulk of my edits as described above.

Then once I've completed those edits and covered all of the big issues, I move the article back into my MDX and re-generate the website.

Finally, I give the article a final read-through to ensure it reads okay and there isn't any glaring issues which breaks the flow of the post.

I won't claim to be a linguistics expert so my posts will likely have a degree of issues but I aim to fix the ones that would stop people understanding the concepts I'm discussing.

### Finishing Touches

Once a post is written and edited, we're on the home straight. The final things I do to a post before publishing it are:

1. Create a cover image
2. Populate the Frontmatter

To create a cover image I use one of the templates that I've created in Figma. I like using templates that share a similar design because it brings a common theme to all of my posts. I used to use a lot of stock images from places like [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). But, I've since shifted mindset and want to use my cover images to create a common theme rather than a series of images which don't seem to connect to the posts.

For the second point, all of my posts have the same frontmatter which are:

```md
title:
date:
tags:
slug:
image:
published:
canonical_url:
description:
```

Before publishing a post I go through and populate all of the revelant fields, this allows for custom SEO for each blog post.

Once this is all complete, I either hit the publish button if it's the day of the post or I push it to GitHub with the `published` frontmatter set to false so it's not displaying on the live site but is ready to go at the press of a button.

### Marketing

The final part of the journey for a blog post is marketing.

I cross-post all of my posts to Medium, Hashnode and Dev.to but also share them on platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn. The goal of this is trying to get as many eyes in front of the post as possible and increase exposure as a whole.

I won't go indepth on cross-posting in this post but if you're interested reading more you can [check out my post here.](https://conermurphy.com/blog/maximising-blog-post-impressions-cross-posting-correct-way/)

For Twitter spefically, I also reshare a post a couple of weeks after it was initially published to attract new people who possibly haven't seen it before. 

Originally I wasn't particularly fond of doing this but then I realised that there's no issues with self-promoting what you're working on and trying to get people to view your content. After all, it's not guarneted others will do it. 

## Twitter Content

Blog posts is only half of the story, I also create a lot of content on Twitter. I normally push out 35 scheduled tweets / threads per week. This may seem a lot but the truth is you have to try to feed the algorthim. It's key to note that there is a difference between spaming out 100's of tweets per week and then actually spending time to create quality content for people to action. 

If you can create quality content for people to action on a regular schedule and are prepared to commit to it for a long people of time then you stand a good chance of seeing positive trends.

### Tools and Aids

If I'm ever asked what tool changed my Twitter game the most, the reply I give is the same every time, [FeedHive.](feedhive.io/) FeedHive is a tweet scheduling platform that completly changed how I use Twitter and how I create content for Twitter. I won't go in depth on FeedHive in this post but if you're interested in improving your Twitter Content Creation abilities, this is the tool to start using. 

Following this, the only other tools I use for creating content on Twitter is Figma for images and graphics on tweets and [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) for code-snippets to use on tweets and graphics.

The only other tool I occasionally use is the in-built Twitter Analytics site so I can see how my tweets are performing and if I'm up or down on the previous month.

If I was to give one tip to someone now starting to create content on Twitter it would be to trust in the data. If you're tweets performance is trending upwards keep doing what you're doing, if it's trending down then it might be time to switch gears. Change an aspect of your posts, give it a few weeks and see if the trends have changed. Repeat this process and eventually you should stumble upon a formula that works for you.

### Timelines & What to Share?

I mention that I post around 35 different tweets/threads per week, What are these? When do I tweet? And how do I fill them? Let's answer these questions.

Below is a screenshot of my current timeline in FeedHive, it shows all of the slots that I have to fill in a week:

// Insert FeedHive timeline screenshot

Throughout the week when I come up with ideas or something that I think would be good to share I create a new draft in FeedHive so that the ideas are there for when I come to write the post.

On either a Saturday or Sunday, I'll sit down and work through all of the slots I need to fill and populate them with a tweet each using the drafts I've created during the week and any new ideas that come to me when I'm making them. 

When you first start doing it, it does feel like a lot of time being committed to content creation but the longer you do it, the easier it becomes. 

#### Reposting

There's a few reasons for this but one of the big ones is that you've built up a backlog of content. There's no shame in re-posting an old piece of content you've made as long as you're not reposting something that you just sent out. 

In fact, reposting is a good thing because it means you can create your weeks content faster and it gives new followers an opportunity to see content they may have not seen before. 

It's importants to find a good balance between reposting old content and creating new content. I aim  for 75% of my weekly content to be brand new, some weeks it may be more and some it will be less. As a rule of thumb as long as you're putting out more new content than recycled content you should be okay but I try to verge on the side of caution and do the bulk of my content as new.

#### Topics

When it comes to what I tweet about, here are the categories: 

- Filler: Quotes, advice or other thoughts I think might help people
- Marketing: Reposting old blog posts
- Blog: Posting out my latest blog post
- Build In Public: Updates on projects I'm working on
- Tips / Tricks: A tip or trick I've recently found or used
- Resources: A thread of resources I find helpful or people can use

I spread these throughout the week and try to vary them as much as possible so people don't get inundated with the same content over and over again for a few days. As a rule of thumb, I tend to do a filler and marketing tweet everyday and then fill the gaps with the other categories. This allows me to put out a variety content throughout the week.

## Summing Up

Overall, creating content for my blog and my Twitter account has been great a journey and I look forward to continuining it going forward. It has allowed me to help others grow while also helping me develop my knowledge and understanding in areas I otherwise wouldn't have.
