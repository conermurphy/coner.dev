HTTP status codes are an integral part of the web, they allow for clear communication between a client and a server. A code can indicate if everything is okay, if there's been an error and where or that it's still in progress. Also, for us developers they can give a great insight into where problems may be occuring. But, did you know that certain status codes can have an impact on your SEO?

In this post, I'm going to cover what HTTP status codes are, the different categories of them and most importantly how certain ones can impact your SEO score. Let's get started.

## What are HTTP status codes?

The definition from [MDN is:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

> HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.

What this means is for every request made they will have a status code that indicates where it was a success or not.

So for example, you click on a webpage and send a request to view it. If there is no issues and the server returns you the webpage then you would get a 200 status code (ok) for that request.

But, as is a common occurence, if you try access a page that doesn't exist the request will be return with a 404 status code (Not Found).

If you want to see the requests you're sending and the status codes of them, you can use the network tab of your browsers developer tools.

_For example, this is a screenshot of the requests I recieved from [my website.](https://conermurphy.com/)_

HTTP status codes are split into five classes, let's take a look at them next.

## The Five Status Classes.

The five classes for HTTP status codes are:

- Information Responses (100-199)
- Successful Responses (200-299)
- Redirects (300-399)
- Client Errors (400-499)
- Server Errors (500-599)

Each of these indicate a different thing to the browser about what is happening. Let's break down each one in a bit more detail.

> You can recieve a response that is not with the list defined above. But that would be a non-standard response and likely custom to the server replying to the request.

### Information Responses

Information responses (100-199) are used to inform the browser that the request is being processed by the server or that the browser should start doing something. For example, a 103 (Early Hints) requests is used to tell the user agent to start preloading resources while the server prepares a response.

### Successful Responses

Successful responses (200-299) indicate that the request was successful and the server has processed the request. The most common example of this type of response is the 200 (OK) response which is sent when a request has succeeded, the message differs depending on the HTTP method used for the request. For example, for a GET request it would be "The resource has been fetched and it transmitted in the message body".

### Redirects

Redirects (300-399) are sent in reply to a request when the user needs to be redirected to another detination or resource. For example, if a URL has been changed you may set up a 301 (Moved Permanently) redirect from the old URL to the new one. This means when the user requests the original URL, the server will reply with a 301 to tell the browser to request again at the new URL. Providing the new request is successful it will reply with a 200 (OK) code.

### Client Errors

Client Errors (400-499) are sent in response to an error originating from the client. For example, if the client requests a resource that does not exist on the server then the server will reply with a 404 (Not Found) code. Or, if the client sends a request that the server could not understand due to invalid syntax, it would respond with a 400 (Bad Request).

### Server Errors

Server Errors (500-599) are sent in response to an error originating from the server. For example, if a server was down for maintenance then it will likely reply with a 503 (Service Unavailable) response. Or, if there was an error that the server doesn't understand how to process it will reply with a 500 (Internal Server Error).

## HTTP Status Codes and SEO

With our overview of the status codes classes finished. Let's take a look at how status codes can impact SEO and what we need to do to stop any negative implications.

Before looking at the most important status codes for SEO, let's cover a common example to see what we should be doing.

Google crawls websites everyday and yours is no excpetion, it constantly checks what URLs are available compared to the previous times it crawled your website. What URLs are sending what status codes and so on. Essentially it builds a complete overview of your domain. Now, this is a vast simplification of what Google is doing, SEO is large and complicated subject but for this post we're going to focus on the status code aspect of it.

For our example, Google is expecting to see a page at the URL `/page-1`, it was there when it last crawled your page and it returned a 200 status code. There is no reason why Google would expect anything different to happen when it crawls it again. But, since Google last crawled your website, you changed the URL to be `/page-a`. Now, in Google's eyes it sees 2 pages, one that did exist and now returns a 404 and a new one that returns a 200.

How should we handle this?

In this scenario the answer is a simple one, the 2 pages are identical but the URLs are different. So we would need to set-up a 301 (Moved Permanently) on the old URL, this 301 would tell Google to redirect to the new URL and scrape that one instead. It's important we use a 301 status for reasons I'll cover in a minute.

Now, let's say that we didn't create the new `/page-a` but still deleted the original `/page-1`, what would be our best course of action. Well, we could still use a 301 to redirect to the most relevant existing page but what if we don't have any relevant pages?

Contray to what is believed it is actually bad practise to redirect every missing page to your home page or another with a 301. The reason for this is because it can be confusing for the user and provides a bad experience. Imagine you're on a clothes website and want to look at a pair of jeans, that page has been deleted and setup with a 301 redirecting to the home page or the overall jeans page. How confusing will it be for you that when you click on the link it redirects you to the jeans page with no explanation.

For this reason, only redirect with a 301 when there actually is another relevant page that serves the same use to the user.

If the page generally doesn't exist anymore and there is no relevant page to redirect to then your best course of action would be to set a 404 response on that URL. While this may sound like a bad thing to do, it actually has it's perks. When Google recieves a 404 for URL it will actually stop indexing that page and crawling it again. In some situations this is helpful. Think about our shop example, if you've sold out of a particular item, you don't want Google to continue listing it so by sending a 404 on the page and removing it from the site you stop people being able to find the sold out item.

It's worth noting that to provide a good experience to your user, it is recommened to provide a custom 404 page that contains revelant links to what they might be interested in. So in our shop example, that particular pair of jeans is sold out so we send the user to a 404 page with a list of similar jeans they might be interested in.

### Most Important Status Codes for SEO

Some status codes are more important for SEO then others, below are 7 status codes that you should pay attention to for good SEO.

#### 200 - OK

This is the response that we all want to see. If all your pages and linked resources are replying with a 200 response that you can rest easy that you've done your job and everything is working okay.

#### 301 - Permanent Redirect

As mentioned earlier a 301 redirect should be used when you want to permanently redirect the user from one resource to another. This means that any users or bots that hit the original URL will be moved over to the new one automatically. Again it's important to ensure that for a good user experience the 2 URLs are revelant to each other.

The most important reason to use a 301 is that the _Link Equity_ is redirected with the URL. Link equity is the special source for good SEO, this is the authority that URL has with Google. So by using a 301 redirect to a new URL, you don't lose any URL authority, it's just pointed to the new URL.

#### 302 - Temporary Redirect

A 302 redirect is very similar to the 301 redirect but with the key difference being that the link equity isn't transferred to the new URL, instead it stays with the old one. For this reason if you're changing any URLs permanently, you need to be using a 301 redirect.

#### 404 - Not Found

A 404 error is the most common error seen on the internet, whenever you hit missing page you'll get greeted by a 404. It's important to note that a 404 doesn't actually specify if the missing page or resource is missing temporarily or permanently. If you've permanently removed a resource or page then you should look at using a 410 response.

As mentioned above there are sometimes where you might want to have 404 response. But, it can be hard to tell when to redirect and when to let it 404.

I found these [3 rules from moz.com for when you should not let a page 404.](https://moz.com/blog/are-404-pages-always-bad-for-seo)

> A) Receives important links to it from external sources
> B) Is receiving a substantive quantity of visitor traffic  
> and/or C) Has an obvious URL that visitors/links intended to reach

If your page doesn't fall into one of these categories then it's okay to let it 404 and provide the user with a suitable 404 custom page.

#### 410 - Gone

A 410 response indicates that the resource or page is gone permanently. A good example of this would be promotional offers, once they are finished they're off the website and gone. A 410 response would be a good response to use on these pages.

410 respones can also help Google speed up removing pages and resources from their index because they don't need to validate if the page is actually missing, we've told them it's gone.

#### 500 - Internal Server Error

A 500 response indicates that there is an issue with the server hosting your website. If your website is replying with a 500 reponse, it should be top of your priority list to get it back online. While a website is sending a 500 response, everyone (including bots) can't access your website.

While the details Google's SEO algorithms aren't public, a ranking factor is the usability of a website. So, it's easy to imagine that your website being offline will negativly impact your SEO.

#### 503 - Service Unavailable

Like the 500 response, a 503 indicates that the server is currently unavailable. But the key difference is that with a 503, everyone (inlcuding bots) are advised to return and try again later.

Because a 503 could be caused by server maintenance or the server being temporarily offline. When a search engine crawler hits a 503 reponse it will return later on and try crawl it again.

## Closing Out

SEO is a large and complicated subject, it goes way further than just sending the right HTTP status codes on your pages but doing this is a good start.

HTTP status codes also provide us with functionality outside of SEO like being able to redirect users to new resources with a 301. So even if SEO isn't top of your priorities (it should be), you still have reasons to use the right response code.
