Having an engaging audience on Twitter is no longer just for celebrities. If you're interested in growing your business, getting a job in tech, finding new clients or selling your products online you need to have an audience that engages with you. If you're interested in achieving this then you need to learn to master your Twitter Analytics so you can see where your mistakes are and how to improve. Here are 6 Twitter Analytics Terms you need to know to grow an audience in 2021.

## Terms we need to know and why

There's a lot of analytics terms out there we could focus on but if we focused on all of them we wouldn't actually have any time left over for achieving our goals. For this reason, I want to focus on 6 of the most important ones that can have a measurable influence on our growth.

### Impressions

Impressions is the number you often see quoted online by marketers and people looking to sell ads. For example "Get your ad infront of 1 million people". What they're referring to here is the number of impressions the content will get. But, there is an important caviet in how it get's represented. If I view the same piece of content twice it get's recorded as 2 impressions not one. So, when they say a million people that could actually be 500,000 twice.

However, even with those caviet it's important that we pay attention to impressions still as they represent the reach of our content. If we create amazing content but we only get 10 impressions then it's unlikely we'll be growing our audience any time soon.

### Engagements

Engagements are the total amount of interactions with our tweets. For example likes, retweets, quote tweets, comments and link clicks are all engagements.

There's a strong case to argue that engagements are more important than impressions when it comes to growing an audience. This is because engagements are actual proof that people like our content, the more engagements we get, the more people we know like it. So, it goes to say that if we keep creating content in a similar vain to our content with the highest engagement more people should like it.

Also, engagements can also start a chain reaction, if people engage with your content then it can lead to more impressions and more impressions leads to more engagement. In short, focus on creating content people will engage with and impressions will follow.

### EPI (Engagements per Impression)

Otherwise known as our Engagement Rate, our EPI is the percentage of engagments we get per impression we get. We can calculate it by dividing our engagements by our number of impressions and multiplying it by 100.

EPI is one of the most important metrics we can look at for growing our audience. While engagements and impressions both tell a story, they don't give the complete picture. EPI solves this by letting us see how our content is performing in relation to the number of people who saw it. This let's us find content that performed well so we can complete a post-mortum on it and try replicate the successfull aspects of it again in the future.

**Example Calculation**

If we had 10 engagements and 100 impressions it would be **10 / 100 \* 100 = 10%**. This would be amazing EPI percentage. Anything above 5% is generally considered to be performing great.

### NF/PC (New Followers per Profile Click)

NF/PC or New Followers per Profile Click is an indication of how well our profile is converting people into followers. Creating engaging content is only half the battle. Good content will get people to your profile page but then you need a great profile to seal the deal and make them follow you for future content.

NF/PC allows us to test, measure and implement new ideas to see if there is a measurable change in the growth of our profile. We can experiment with different variables such as profile image, banner, bio and pinned tweet and let the changes sit for a period of time to see if there was any change in our NF/PC. Over a period of time we can optimise our profile to be as high converting as possible so we just need to focus on making great engaging content to funnel people there.

**Example Calculation**

If we had 50 New Followers and 900 Profile Clicks it would be **50 / 900 \* 100 = 5.5%**.

### PC/I (Profile Click per Impression)

If NF/PC is tracking how many people convert from clicking on our profile to following us, we should also be tracking how many people are actually clicking on our profile after seeing our content. This is where PC/I or Profile Click per Impression comes in. We want to see the rate at which people are visting our profile after seeing our content.

Combining this with NF/PC allows us to get a complete picture of the funnel from people seeing our content to converting into followers. By looking at these two metrics in tandom we can see where our issues are. Is it that we struggle to get people to our profile (our content needs to improve) or is it we get people to our profile but can't convert them to followers (our profile needs to improve).

**Example Calculation**

If we had 800 Profile Clicks and 6000 Impressions it would be **800 / 6000 \* 100 = 13%**.

### Link Clicks

The final metric I want to cover in this post is link clicks. It's likely that if you're interested in growing your business or getting people to purchase a product you've made that you'll need to get people clicking on links to view said products.

By tracking our link click analytics, we can look back at previous tweets with links in to see how well they performed. We can then learn lessons from the best performing tweets and optimise our future content to get as many people as possible clicking on the links.

## Why percentage based analytics are better

Throughout this post so far you may have noticed that there is 2 types of analytics I've discussed.

- Number Based
- Percentage Based

When it comes to measuring the growth of our Twitter account and optimising our content by looking at previous content. I believe that the best metrics to look at aare percentage based ones. This is for a couple of reasons.

### Scale with your following

Percentage based metrics scale better with larger audiences. If you went solely on the number of engagements or impressions you get on your content then as your account grows you'll always think that your latest content is the best because you now have a larger reach than you do before. In fact, if you look at your EPI you may find that some of your older content when you had a smaller audience was actually better, try learn from this content and see if you replicate similar results going forward.

### Allows for Past comparison

As I elouded to in the last point with percentage based metrics you can easily compare your past performance with your current performance. For example, if you had two pieces of content that had the same EPI but when you posted the second piece of content your following and impressions was 10 times higher than the first time, your engagements would also need to be 10 times higher to keep the EPI the same across the tweets.

Essentially, when looking at percentages you can forget about the actual numbers and just focused on the performance of the tweet itself regardless of how large or small your audience was.

## Accessing your Twitter Analytics

Now we've covered what analytics you need to be looking at and why you should be using percentage based metrics let's cover the options we have for accessing our analytics.
