Recently, while scrolling through my timeline I came across the below tweet from [Dan Spratling](https://twitter.com/dan_spratling/) and it got me thinking about why we should be designing components on our websites and not pages as traditionally done.

<Tweet tweet="1401103660785049600" />

In this post I wanted to cover why I think designing components is better for designing (and developing) websites and how it can be beneficial for us.

Let's jump in.

## Consistent and Efficent Design

If you've ever spent time trying to replicate the exact same element across two pages you'll appreciate how hard it can be to make the two designs identical to eachother in the contexts of different pages. By designing individual components we remove this issue because the component is already made all we need to do is drop the component onto the new page.

Because the component is self-contained and isolated in it's existence we can add or remove it as we please across multiple pages or areas of our website making our designing more efficent and consistent while reducing the amount of errors and mistakes we introduce by trying to replicate the same design. 

## Responsivity

By designing components in isolation from the pages they will be displayed on we can formulate, revise and implemnet an individual plan for responsivity on each element of the design. This means that each component will be responsive by nature and by extension the overall page will be responsive as well. This greatly reduces the amount of time we need to spend after the fact making the design responsive because we did all the work up front ensuring each component was responsive in isolation.

## Smaller Codebase and Quicker Development

By designing and developing individual components that we can re-use throughout our website or application we reduce the amount of code we need to write. 

When developing components with this mindset, it pays to make generalise the components so that the content within them can shift and change as required but the design stays the same. This means you only need to write the component once and then can pass the content in as required.

Because we are removing the need to re-create the same component multiple times it means we can cut down on the development time of the project and spend more time ensuring the project is fit for purpose and meets all of our client needs.

## Closing Out

In closing, the mindset shift to designing and developing in components rather than pages yields multiple benefits. A more consistent and efficent design, a more reponsive design, a smaller more efficent codebase and a better development experience. By shifting to this mindset we can spen more time planning out our design making the entire journey from concept to finished product smoother and faster while maintaining product quality and not comprimising on our clients needs. 

After moving to this mindset for my latest website redesign I can safely say I won't be moving back to page level designing any time soon, it made the entire process smoother and more enjoyable for me. I highly recommend giving it a try on your next project.

Once again, I just want to say thank you to Dan for letting me feature his tweet for this blog post and sparking my initial curtiousty in this way of designing. If you haven't already I highly recommend [checking out Dan's work on his website](danspratling.dev/) and [following him on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/dan_spratling/)
