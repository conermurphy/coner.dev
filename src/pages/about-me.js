              I'm a Freelance Website Developer from the UK. I specialise in building beautiful and easy-to-use websites for businesses and
              individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is to help everyone achieve their goals by giving them a great online presence. No matter if you're a business or an
              individual, I want to help you succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been building websites as a hobbyist since I was in High School. But, in the last few years in particular I've
              developed a deep passion for building websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              I aim to give everyone involved a great experience. From the end-user using the website day-to-day. To the individual or team
              maintaining and uploading new content. A great website doesn't stop at what the user's see, it's much more than that.

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>
              For as long as I can remember, I've loved technology. From a young age, I've always wanted to know how something works. And as
              I got older, this natural curiosity grew with me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I moved from taking apart toys to tearing down computers and building my own. To this day I describe building computers as
              adult Lego (not everyone believes me on this).
            </p>
            <p>
              5 years ago my interest shifted from playing with hardware to building software. In particular, building great websites and
              web applications. Over time, this interest grew until last year when I got the opportunity to make a website for a friend.
            </p>
            <p>This is when I realised that building websites is what I want to do full time and started to build a business.</p>
