        <p>
          I don't plan on making this a long-winded document that will cause most people to switch off before they get to the truly
          important information. For this reason, I'm going to make this as concise as possible will also still addressing all of the
          required points.

          address onto my email newsletter for future communication but this is completely optional.

          Website analytics have also been included on this website in the form of Google Analytics. This has been configured with all
          advertising, IP tracking, and demographics collection features turned off. No personal data is shared with Google Analytics.
