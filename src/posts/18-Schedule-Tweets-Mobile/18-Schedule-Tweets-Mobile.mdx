## Scheduling Tweets

Scheduling tweets has been available on the web app for a couple of months now after it's [initial release](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273940/twitter-schedule-draft-tweets-web-app) on 28th May 2020. But, there has been no movement on whether or not we are going to be able to do it on a mobile device, at present we can't and there's no signs of this changing any time soon. 

So, instead I had to come up with a different system for scheduling tweets.

## Existing Solutions

Currently, you have the option of using 3rd party solutions for managing your scheduled tweets. Services like [Hootsuite]() and [Buffer]() have been around for a while and offer varying services for you to use. However, unless you're scheduling a small amount of tweets you'll likely hit into a pay-wall that requires a monthly subscription to overcome. 

Following this, I personally find that a lot of 3rd party solutions don't quite live up to the experience that the original app offers, this may change with [Twitters API V2]() being released soon but that's a post for another time. My main issue with using 3rd party solutions is I shouldn't need to. The web app has the features we need already integrated, how hard can it be to port them over to the mobile app as well?

## My Solution

Now, some will argue that this isn't much of a solution but I believe it is. Or, at least more of a solution than we have been provided with without shelling out money for a service for one feature.

I'm a big user of [Notion]() which for the uninitiated is a web app that allows you to record notes, creates lists / spreadsheets and much more. It's honestly really cool and I heavily recommend you check it out. In fact, I've got an upcoming post on how I use Notion in my daily workflow to organise myself and my projects as a web developer. If you're looking forward to this please let me know over on [Twitter.]()

But, I digress. On Notion I have a Marketing page which is a space for me to plan and develop ideas of how I want to market myself and the work I do like blog posts. So, naturally I've included a space for Tweets and topics I want to cover. You can probably see where this is going.

Whenever I come up with an idea for a tweet or something that I think could be turned into a tweet in the future, I open up my Notion app and record down the tweet idea along with what day and time it will be tweeted at.

This allows me to quickly note down multiple tweets without needing to worry about the fine details of the tweet or making sure it's grammar is good. Instead, it's a space to leave ideas and topics that I can then later revisit when I come to actually scheduling them on Twitter.

### Scheduling Tweets

As I'm unable to schedule all my tweets as I think of them using the app, I instead spend 5/10 minutes every evening laying out the tweets I've recorded for the next day by checking the content of them, making sure the spelling and grammar are okay and then scheduling them via the Twitter web app for the next day.

During this time is where I also make any images associated with the tweets which is another great time saver as I don't need to worry about making the image the moment I want to schedule the tweet. Because I wait till the end of the day to schedule the following days tweets I can focus on my work without getting distracted by making tweets and then in my allocated 5/10 minutes I can sit down and focus on finishing off the tweets and making them look good.

And, as I'm always building a back log of tweets on my Notion page, I never need to worry about not having tweets to schedule or possibly forgetting a tweet as I'm unable to schedule it the moment I think of it.

Overall, I would say this method has it's downsides like it relies you essentially double entering the tweet on two separate systems and if you forget to move them across than nothing gets sent out. But, I think the flexibility this system gives me along with not needing to perfect the tweet the moment I think of it allowing me to batch work on my tweets has proven to be a great productivity booster.

With this all being said it will be interesting to see the new apps and solutions that are made using Twitters V2 API but only time will tell what they are like.

I hope you enjoyed this article and I would love to hear if you have a solution for scheduling tweets on mobile, please share it with me by tweeting me [@MrConerMurphy]()
