## Series Introduction

The JavaScript Array data type currently has 37 methods on it according to the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) and in this series we are going to cover them all one by one explaining each one with examples as we work our way down the list. 

If you have any questions regarding anything in this series please get in contact with me by using the methods listed at the bottom of this post and if you think I've got something wrong please create a pull request on GitHub to correct the information (link at the bottom of the article).

This is post #3 in this series if you're interested in reading the other posts in this series you will find a complete list with links at the bottom of this post.

## Method #3: Array.of()

Array.of() allows for the creation of a new Array instance using the passed in values regardless of how many of them there are and what type of data they are. Array.of() will take the passed in values and return a new array containing those elements. 

### Creating Arrays

You may be asking why would we need a method like this considering there are multiple over ways of creating an array from data, you could for instance call the Array constructor and pass in the values you want to put in the array like so:

```javascript
Array('str',3,1) // Array(3) [ "str", 3, 1 ]
```

Now this is all good but there is one key difference which separates the Array constructor and the Array.of() method and that is how they handle single integer values being passed to them.

If you were to pass a single integer to the Array constructor like so:

```javascript
Array(3)
```

You would expect it to output:

```javascript
[3]
```

But, it doesn't. You see when you pass in a single integer to the Array constructor it will actually return a new array with that many empty slots, not even undefined. Just completely empty. Here is what the console would show as being returned for the above code:

```javascript
// Array(3) [ <3 empty slots> ]
```

Now if we take the same values and pass it through Array.of() we get a different response:

```javascript
Array.of(3) // [ 3 ]
```

As you can see we actually get a proper array returned to us with the value we expected to see in it. 

Now, this is definitely one of the more niche methods on the Array.prototype as there are so many more ways of creating arrays in JavaScript but this a good one to be aware of should you ever come across it.

## Examples

Although this is a pretty small method with not many working parts, let's look at some examples to further cement it. 

```javascript
Array.of(1,2,3,4,5); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
Array.of({hello: 1}, 2, 'str', true); // [ {â€¦}, 2, "str", true ]
Array.of(undefined, null, false, 0); // [ undefined, null, false, 0 ]
```

So, as you can see from the above examples, you can make anything into an array using this method as long as the value you are passing is a valid value but being honest I can't find a reason to use this method over just passing our values into '[]'. 

I suppose this is the beautiful thing about programming there is always more than one way to achieve our goals. But, if you do know a good use-case for using Array.of() over another way of creating arrays please let me know over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrConerMurphy).

As always if you have any questions or just want to chat you can find me on any of the methods listed below. I hope you enjoyed this post and if you did I would greatly appreciate it if you would consider sharing it so someone else could find it useful.
